# 📈 Regression Algorithms From Scratch 🤖  

Welcome to **Regression-Algorithms-From-Scratch**!  
This repository demonstrates how popular **Regression models** work under the hood — implemented **step by step**, with zero reliance on pre‑built ML libraries.  

Learn how algorithms think, not just how to use them. 🧠✨  

---

## ✨ Features  
✅ Pure **Python** implementations — no black boxes  
✅ Clear math explanations & inline comments  
✅ Visualizations for better understanding 📊  
✅ Great for students and self‑taught ML enthusiasts
